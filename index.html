                Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive. 
                Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you.

                Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. 
                This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. 
                Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. 
                Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull.

                    Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. You talk about vengeance.
                     Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. 
                     Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. 
                     Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in.

                        I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. 
                        You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? 
                        Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.

        <p>What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull.

            It's not personal. It's business. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over!</p>
